# JavaScript - Demonstration Site
####Author: Jeanis Sananikone

####Background
A website developed for my Client-Side Programming class. 

####Description
* Every web page, except index.html, uses JavaScript to add functionality. It's recommended to use FireFox or Internet Explorer to ensure every component works on every web page.
	
* Calculator - A simple calculator
	
	 - Users can click on the buttons just like a normal calculator or type the equation in the text box
	 - If users enter invalid characters such as letters and invalid operators, the calculator will fail to calculate the equation and do nothing
	  
* Primes - A simple form that asks for two numbers from the user
	
	 - The two numbers represent the first number and the ending number
	 - When the user clicks submit, the numbers will be validated and if there errors, message boxes will appear with the appropriate error
	 - If everything is valid, the user will be redirected to a new web page that contains a table with all the prime numbers between the two numbers provided by the user
	  
* Ads - Demonstrates a simple countdown feature 
  
  - Users can see how the ad changes after each second
  - Users can click Skip Advertisement to be redirected to a "Home Page", this will open the page in a new tab
	
* Forms - A photo ordering form (Demonstration)
  - Users must fill all of the form fields before submitting
  - If fields are empty or invalid, their respective errors will appear and the form will not submit
  - **Image sources are below**
  - Processes the submission to a "ImageFormProcessor.html" where users can see the data they submitted

* Objects - Same photo ordering form as above
  - Users must fill all of the form fields before submitting
  - If fields are empty or invalid, their respective errors will appear and the form will not submit
  - **Image sources are below**
  - Processes the submission on the same page and uses JavaScript objectes to validate, process, and display the data entered
  
* REGEX - A standard form used to gather user information
  - Users must fill in all the fields unless it is marked "Optional"
  - Regular expressions is used to validate the format of certain fields
  - If field(s) is invalid, the appropriate error will display
  - Once submitted, the user will be redirected to the processing page that displays all the information entered
  - **User information is not actually stored**
  
* Cookie - A standard form used to gather user information
  - Users must fill in all the fields unless it is marked "Optional"
  - Regular expressions is used to validate the format of certain fields
  - If field(s) is invalid, the appropriate error will display
  - After the form is submitted, cookies will be created to be used by FormProcessor_Cookie.html to display
  - **Please make sure cookies are enabled**
  
* Shop - A simple page that mimics an online shop
  - As users "add" or "removes" items to their shopping cart, the appropriate prices will change and display
  - **Image sources are below**
  
* Promo - The same web page as shop but with an ad
  - An advertisement will appear before users can interact with the shop
